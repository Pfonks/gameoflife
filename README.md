# gameoflife

Simple implementation of Conways Game of Life in C++ with variable grid size and max cycle count. Uses a random seed by default.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Fix detection for changes which currently only works for some seeds
- [ ] Optionally provide seed to begin with
- [ ] Output to a scalable window instead of cli
